List of how everyone died

#TODO bosses:

##Kagraz

+ Charring Breath - Probably a direct hit sort of deal
+ Charring Breath - More than one stack

+ Blazing Radiance - Periodic hits probably, but also depends on who is targeted
+ Magma Monsoon - Direct Damage
+ Fixate

+ Rising Flames - Tank debuff

+ Devastating Slam
+ Drop the Hammer


##Hans'gar & Franzok

Searing Plates - Times hit
Pulverized - Times hit
Aftershock - Track how many times you get hit by body slam when you aren't the target, OR track damage taken. I think stacks may be best

Crippling Suplex - Probably not worth tracking. We can see if they died to it in the obituary

##Kromog

Fists of Stone - Only tanks should be hit by this, and ideally both tanks are hit by it at the same time.
Reverberations - Don't get hit by the discs of sound
Rippling Smash - Don't be in the direction the boss is facing to avoid this
Rune of Crushing Earth - Hands slapping
Stone Wall - Hand coming out of ground
Thundering Blows - Didn't trap themselves in a rune of grasping earth

Rune of grasping earth - make sure you escape quickly. Might be worth logging people who are trapped over X amount of time.
Stone Breath - Ideally we would like to know if the tanks are failing this. Find a way to track excessive stone breaths.

Warped Armor - Max 3 stacks ideally
